# MinesweeperClone

The project should open up on the Mineswepper Map, ready to be played. If not, the Mineswepper map can be found at the Root of the Content folder. 

I created the project using the Unreal Engine 4.27.2 Puzzle C++ template to help me get started. 

I have moved all the C++ files that came with it to a unused folder to differentiate between code that I have written and code that came with the template. 

I created:
  - MinesweeperGrid.cpp
  - MinesweeperGrid.h
  - GridSquare.cpp
  - GridSquare.h
  - MinesweeperGameMode.cpp
  - MinesweeperGameMode.h
  - MyPawn.cpp
  - MyPawn.h
  - MyPlayerController.cpp
  - MyPlayerController.h
